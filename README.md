ML model to predict # of points Lebron James will score next season

I pulled the NBA stat data from the balldontlie api. Built features using the data and then used scikit-learn regressors to build the machine learning models.

V1 - Predict total points scored by Lebron James next season
V2 - Model age-related decline
V3 - Cluster players similar to Lebron and then use those players stats as additional training data
